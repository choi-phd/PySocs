I view AI as a very technologically impressive imitation of a parrot: it can string things it heard before together, but it does not understand the meaning or context of those things.

Until AI can truly understand meaning and context in order to truly comprehend a problem, rather than stringing together loosely associated ideas in the hopes of sounding correct, AI will continue to be incorrect and prone to hallucinations.  Even if we managed a truly sentient AI with human cognition, I believe an AI may produce incorrect data due to misinformation, much in the same way as real people.

Humans will need all of those skills to correct AI's mistakes.",136000,6
